        <p>The Jeonju hanok village or Jeonju hanok maeul is located outside the Jeonju city center and houses over 800 traditional Korean hanok buildings and houses. The low houses made out of wood, clay and unique roofs give this village a unique atmosphere. Many of these houses have been turned into restaurants, accommodations, boutiques and galleries. It is a village filled with charm and historical value.</p>
        
        <h2 id="blog2">Jeju Island</h2>
        <h6>18.08.20</h6>
        
        <p>Seogwipo City, which lies in the south of the island is a smaller and more laid back city. Most of Jejuâ€™s museums, Jeju Island resorts and hiking trails are located in the south part of the island, which makes Seogwipo City a great base.

Another area to stay at Jungmun Area, which is also located in the south and filled with big resort hotels. Perfect if you just want to relax.</p>
